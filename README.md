# IntroMachineLearningCapstone

Welcome to the ML Capstone Project! The full written report file is the ITSC5356CapstoneReport.pdf. Below I will detail the remaining files that are contained in this repo.

house-prices-advanced-regression
 - taken from kaggle, containing the AMES dataset

AmesHousing.csv
 - was used in the XGBoost_Model by the paper authors but omitted from my implementation. Still included for reference

LinearRegression.ipynb
 - contains the working code for linear regression

NaiveBayes.ipynb
 - contains the working code for naive Bayes

NeuralNetwork.ipynb
 - contains the working code for neural network

StackedGeneralization2.ipynb
 - contains the working code for standard generalization

StackedGeneralization1.ipynb
 - contains an additional sample model that does not use LightGBM in its stacking. Still included for pipeline visualization

XGBoost_Model.ipynb
 - contains the working code for XGBoost

final_from_df2.csv
 - used in XGBoost_Model as input, the cleaned data

All .png are visualizations/plots for their respective models
